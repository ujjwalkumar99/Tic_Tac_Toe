# Tic_Tac_Toe Game
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (Dot &amp; Cross) game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game features an animated UI with a dark theme and modern icons, making it visually appealing and engaging.
The project is developed as part of a Python Developer Internship at TechnoHacksEduTech. It serves as a hands-on exercise for GUI development using Tkinter and image processing using the PIL library.

Feel free to explore and enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe (Dot & Cross) with this Python GUI game!

Note: To run the game, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Simply clone the repository and execute the "Dot & Cross.py" script to start the game.
